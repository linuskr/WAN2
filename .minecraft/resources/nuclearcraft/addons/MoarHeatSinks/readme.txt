Thank you for downloading Moar Heat Sinks. This add-on requires NuclearCraft: Overhauled and CraftTweaker. Once you already have those mods installed, continue on to installing this add-on. To install Moar Heat Sinks, follow these simple steps:

1. Move this entire folder to your Minecraft folder at resources/nuclearcraft/addons. If this directory does not currently exist, you will have have to make it yourself. When you're done, it should look as follows: the folder named addons contains the folder MoarHeatSinks, which itself contains several subfolders.

2. Voila. You're done.
